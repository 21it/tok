# Design Guidelines

Tok has a fairly rigorous set of design guidelines followed to ensure the best experience for users.
These are heavily enforced, which may come as a surprise compared to other KDE apps which usually go for a "good enough" approach.

## Principles

### Design for The Medium

"Design for the medium" is one of the most basic things in a good design, and Tok holds to this strongly.

In practical terms, this means Tok rarely displays the same UI adapted to mobile and desktop, and instead, has tailored UIs for both.

### Discoverability

Tok does not settle for "shove it in a hamburger menu" or "shove it in a drawer" and calls it a day.
All features in Tok are actively discoverable.
Even obscure details such as the icons on file messages being draggable are explicitly announced to the user when the user first encounters one, instead of leaving them to find out for themselves.
