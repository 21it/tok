# Tok

KDE's convergent Telegram client.

# Building

Tok uses Qbs to build.

```
qbs
```

The binary will be output in ./default, assuming you have all dependencies.
Tok depends on the latest version of [Td](https://github.com/tdlib/td), and Qt >= 5.15, with `widgets`, `qml`, `quick`, and `concurrent` modules installed.
CMake is required in order to utilise Td.
